# Seq2Seq Machine Translator

This project implements a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for Italian-to-English translation using PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `models/`: Contains the model definitions (Encoder, Decoder, Seq2Seq).
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for data loading, training, and evaluation.
- `main.py`: Script for training the model.
- `run.py`: Script for interactive translation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

### Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python main.py
